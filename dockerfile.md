# Create Images using Dockerfiles (1/2)

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

 - Write a Dockerfile using the `FROM` and `RUN` commands
 - Build an image from a Dockerfile
 - Anticipate which image layers will be fetched from the cache at build time
 - Fetch build history for an image
 
## Writing and Building a Dockerfile

1.  Create a folder called `myimage`, and a text file called `Dockerfile` within that folder. In `Dockerfile`, include the following instructions:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM centos:7

    RUN yum update -y
    RUN yum install -y wget
    ```

    This serves as a recipe for an image based on `centos:7`, that has all its default packages updated and `wget` installed on top.

2.  Build your image with the `build` command. Don't miss the `.` at the end; that's the path to your `Dockerfile`. Since we're currently in the directory `myimage` which contains it, the path is just `.` (here).

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker image build -t myimage .
    ```

    You'll see a long build output - we'll go through the meaning of this output in a demo later. For now, everything is good if it ends with `Successfully tagged myimage:latest`.

3.  Verify that your new image exists with `docker image ls`, then use it to run a container and `wget` something from within that container, just to confirm that everything worked as expected:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run -it myimage bash
    [root@1d86d4093cce /]# wget example.com
    [root@1d86d4093cce /]# cat index.html
    [root@1d86d4093cce /]# exit
    ```

    You should see the HTML from example.com, downloaded by `wget` from within your container.    

4.  It's also possible to pipe a Dockerfile in from STDIN; try rebuilding your image with the following:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ cat Dockerfile | docker image build -t myimage -f - .
    ```

    (This is useful when reading a Dockerfile from a remote location with `curl`, for example).

## Using the Build Cache

In the previous step, the second time you built your image should have completed immediately, with each step save the first reporting `using cache`. Cached build steps will be used until a change in the Dockerfile is found by the builder.

1.  Open your Dockerfile and add another `RUN` step at the end to install `vim`:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM centos:7

    RUN yum update -y
    RUN yum install -y wget
    RUN yum install -y vim
    ```

2.  Build the image again as above; which steps is the cache used for?

3.  Build the image again; which steps use the cache this time?

4.  Swap the order of the two `RUN` commands for installing `wget` and `vim` in the Dockerfile:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM centos:7

    RUN yum update -y
    RUN yum install -y vim
    RUN yum install -y wget
    ```

    Build one last time. Which steps are cached this time?

## Using the `history` Command

1.  The `docker image history` command allows us to inspect the build cache history of an image. Try it with your new image:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker image history myimage:latest

    IMAGE          CREATED          CREATED BY                                      SIZE      
    f2e85c162453   8 seconds ago    /bin/sh -c yum install -y wget                  87.2MB              
    93385ea67464   12 seconds ago   /bin/sh -c yum install -y vim                   142MB               
    27ad488e6b79   3 minutes ago    /bin/sh -c yum update -y                        86.5MB              
    5182e96772bf   44 hours ago     /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["/bin/bash"]            0B                  
    <missing>      44 hours ago     /bin/sh -c #(nop)  LABEL org.label-schema....   0B                  
    <missing>      44 hours ago     /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:6340c690b08865d...   200MB 
    ```

    Note the image id of the layer built for the `yum update` command.

2.  Replace the two `RUN` commands that installed `wget` and `vim` with a single command:

    ```bash
    ...
    RUN yum install -y wget vim
    ```

3.  Build the image again, and run `docker image history` on this new image. How has the history changed?

## Conclusion

In this exercise, we've seen how to write a basic Dockerfile using `FROM` and `RUN` commands, some basics of how image caching works, and seen the `docker image history` command. Using the build cache effectively is crucial for images that involve lengthy compile or download steps; in general, moving commands that change frequently as late as possible in the Dockerfile will minimize build times. We'll see some more specific advice on this later in this lesson.

# Create Images using Dockerfiles (2/2)

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

 - Define a default process for an image to containerize by using the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` Dockerfile commands
 - Understand the differences and interactions between `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` 

## Setting Default Commands

1.  Add the following line to your Dockerfile from the last problem, at the bottom:

    ```bash
    ...
    CMD ["ping", "127.0.0.1", "-c", "5"]
    ```

    This sets `ping` as the default command to run in a container created from this image, and also sets some parameters for that command.

2.  Rebuild your image:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker image build -t myimage .
    ```

3.  Run a container from your new image with no command provided:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage
    ```

    You should see the command provided by the `CMD` parameter in the Dockerfile running.

4.  Try explicitly providing a command when running a container:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage echo "hello world"
    ```

    Providing a command in `docker container run` overrides the command defined by `CMD`.

5.  Replace the `CMD` instruction in your Dockerfile with an `ENTRYPOINT`:

    ```bash
    ...
    ENTRYPOINT ["ping"]
    ```

6.  Build the image and use it to run a container with no process arguments:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker image build -t myimage .
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage
    ```

    You'll get an error. What went wrong?

7.  Try running with an argument after the image name:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage 127.0.0.1
    ```

    You should see a successful ping output. Tokens provided after an image name are sent as arguments to the command specified by `ENTRYPOINT`.

## Combining Default Commands and Options

1.  Open your Dockerfile and modify the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction to include 2 arguments for the ping command:

    ```bash
    ...
    ENTRYPOINT ["ping", "-c", "3"]
    ```

2.  If `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are both specified in a Dockerfile, tokens listed in `CMD` are used as default parameters for the `ENTRYPOINT` command. Add a `CMD` with a default IP to ping:

    ```bash
    ...
    CMD ["127.0.0.1"]
    ```

3.  Build the image and run a container with the defaults:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker image build -t myimage .
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage
    ```

    You should see it pinging the default IP, `127.0.0.1`.

4.  Run another container with a custom IP argument:

    ```bash
    [centos@desotech myimage]$ docker container run myimage 8.8.8.8
    ```

    This time, you should see a ping to `8.8.8.8`. Explain the difference in behavior between these two last containers.

## Conclusion

In this exercise, we encountered the Dockerfile commands `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`. These are useful for defining the default process to run as PID 1 inside the container right in the Dockerfile, making our containers more like executables and adding clarity to exactly what process was meant to run in a given image's containers.
